# practical-ds-projects
A combination of small projects I did. The projects are: 
- Coursera's Practical Data Science with MATLAB Specialization capstone project: In 2015, the CEO of a taxi company in New York City needs you to clarify his profitable idea in the next year. He claimed that dispatching the taxi fleet in Manhattan and airports would generate higher revenue because of the demand at those locations. As a data scientist leader, you are responsible for verifying the CEO's hypothesis. Using the taxi pickup and dropoff data in 2015, predict the demand and revenue gained from dispatching the taxifleet in said locations in 2016.
- Internship: a university internship report on machine theory, kinematic and dynamic of mechanisms like one-link, slider-crank, cam, etc. The code I used was MATLAB and Python, with presentation in LaTeX.
- Course Report: I used LaTeX to produce reports in various courses during my university.
